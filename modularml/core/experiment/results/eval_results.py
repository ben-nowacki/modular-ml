class EvalResults(PhaseResults):
    """
    Results container for a single forward-pass evaluation phase.

    Description:
        EvalResults wraps the outputs of an EvalPhase, which executes a single
        epoch (epoch=0) over multiple batches. This class provides convenience
        methods for:

        - Automatic tensor stacking across batches
        - Loss aggregation (sum/mean) over batches

        All methods leverage the base PhaseResults query interface and use
        AxisSeries.collapse() for batch aggregation.

    Attributes:
        label (str): Phase label inherited from :class:`PhaseResults`.


    Example:
        Accessing EvalPhase results

        >>> # Run evaluation
        >>> eval_results = experiment.run_evaluation(phase=eval_phase)  # doctest: +SKIP
        >>> # Get stacked outputs for a node (all batches concatenated)
        >>> outputs = eval_results.stacked_tensors(  # doctest: +SKIP

        Retrieve tensors for a node, concatenated across all batches.

        Description:
            Collects tensors from the specified domain across all evaluation
            batches and concatenates them along the batch dimension using
            backend-aware concatenation (torch.cat, np.concatenate, or tf.concat).

            This is the primary method for retrieving complete evaluation outputs
            or targets in a single tensor.

            node (str | GraphNode):
                The node to retrieve tensors for. Can be the node instance,

                - tags: any tracked tags during the node's forward pass
                - sample_uuids: the sample identifiers
            role (str, optional):
                If multi-role data, specifies which role to return.
                Defaults to "default".
            fmt (DataFormat | None, optional):
                Format to cast returned tensors to. If None, uses as-produced
                format. Defaults to None.
            unscale (bool, optional):
                Whether to inverse any applied scalers. Only valid for tail
                nodes with domain in ["outputs", "targets"]. Defaults to False.

        Returns:
