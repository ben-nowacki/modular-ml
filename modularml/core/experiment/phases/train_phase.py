            Multiple bindings may share the same effective sampling “execution”:
            same upstream FeatureSet, same split restriction, and same (hashable)
            sampler configuration. In that case, we should only materialize batches
            once, and reuse the resulting SampledView for all bindings in the group.

            Grouping is conservative:
                - If sampler config is missing or unhashable -> do not dedupe.
                - If sampler has no `get_config()` -> do not dedupe.

        Iterate over all execution steps for this training phase.

        This generator produces a sequence of :class:`ExecutionContext`
        objects representing the full training schedule of the phase,
        across all epochs and all batch steps within each epoch.

        The execution flow is:

        1. Group input bindings into unique sampler executions via
           ``_build_sampler_executions()``. Samplers with identical configuration,
           FeatureSet, and split are executed only once and shared across bindings.

        2. For each sampler execution, obtain the number of materialized batches
           from its :class:`SampledView`.

        3. For each epoch:

           a. Generate a step-wise batch schedule using ``_iter_schedule()``
              according to ``self.batch_schedule``.

           b. For each schedule step, construct the inputs for *all* head-node
              bindings:

              - If a sampler is active in the current step, its corresponding
                batch is selected.
              - If a sampler is inactive (ALTERNATE policies), its inputs are
                replaced with a fully masked :class:`BatchView`.

        4. Yield an :class:`ExecutionContext` containing:

           - Phase label
           - Epoch index
           - Batch index (within the epoch)
           - Resolved input :class:`BatchView` objects for all bindings

        Notes:
            - ZIP scheduling policies always provide one batch per sampler per step.
            - ALTERNATE scheduling policies activate exactly one sampler per step;
              all others are masked.
            - No semantic alignment between samplers is performed here. Any required
              alignment (e.g., contrastive pairs or matched samples) must be handled
              inside the sampler itself via roles.
            - The yielded :class:`ExecutionContext` objects are intended to be
              consumed directly by the ModelGraph training loop
              (e.g., ``ModelGraph.train_step(ctx)``).

            results (TrainResults | None, optional):
                Optional container in which results will be registered.
            show_sampler_progress (bool, optional):
                Whether to show a progress bar for sampler batching.
                Defaults to True.
            show_training_progress (bool, optional):

                Whether to leave all progress bars visible after completion.
                Overrides all nested progress bar persistence settings.
                Defaults to ``IN_NOTEBOOK`` (True in notebooks, False in scripts).
            persist_epoch_progress (bool, optional):
                Whether to leave per-epoch training bars visible after completion.
                Defaults to ``IN_NOTEBOOK``.
            val_loss_metric (str, optional):
                Name of a recorded validation loss metric to display in the
                progress bar. Results must be tracked and the metric must exist.
                If not, no validation loss field will be shown.
