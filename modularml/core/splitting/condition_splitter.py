class ConditionSplitter(BaseSplitter):
    """
    Splits a FeatureSetView into subsets based on user-defined logical conditions.

    Description:
        Each subset is defined by one or more filtering rules expressed as
        a mapping `{field_name: condition}`, where `condition` can be:
          - A literal value (exact match)
          - A sequence of allowed values
          - A callable (predicate) that returns True/False

        Fields may reference feature, target, or tag keys from the FeatureSet schema.

    Example:
        ```python
        splitter = ConditionSplitter(
            low_temp={"temperature": lambda x: x < 20},
            high_temp={"temperature": lambda x: x >= 20},
            cell_5={"cell_id": 5},
        )
        splits = splitter.split(fs_view, return_views=True)
        ```

        If a sample satisfies multiple subset conditions, a warning is raised and
        the sample will appear in multiple subsets.
