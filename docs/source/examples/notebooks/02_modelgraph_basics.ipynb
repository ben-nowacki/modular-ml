    "## Building a ModelGraph\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most powerful aspects of ModularML is its `ModelGraph` abstraction, which represents a directed-acyclic-graph (DAG) of computation. This structure allows multiple `ModelStage` instances to be flexibly connected into a larger model pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each `ModelStage` can use any supported backend, such as PyTorch, TensorFlow/Keras, or Scikit-learn. This enables the creation of complex multi-objective modeling workflows using a unified interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we demonstrate a two-stage modeling pipeline: a CNN encoder processes input voltage features into a latent embedding, followed by an MLP regressor that estimates the battery state-of-health (SOH) from this embedding.\n",
    "\n",
    "ModularML provides pre-built classes for commonly used model types such as sequential CNNs and MLPs. While we use those here, any custom model can be integrated by subclassing `modularml.BaseModel` and implementing the required methods.\n",

Please refer to the module documentation for a full list of available initialization parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key feature of the `ModelStage` abstraction is its support for **lazy shape inference**. Input and output shapes do not need to be explicitly specified during model construction. Instead, ModularML dynamically infers the required shapes at runtime based on how FeatureSets and other ModelStages are connected in the ModelGraph.\n",
    "\n",
    "While input shape inference is automatic, it is generally advisable to specify the desired output shape for clarity and to avoid unintended behavior.\n",
    "\n",

    "* `inplace`: if True, modifies the current graph directly; if False, returns a new graph with the insertion.\n",

    "How it rewires the graph:\n",
